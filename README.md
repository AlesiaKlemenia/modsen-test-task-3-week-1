## Implemented functionality

* Search form with working filtering and search using the `Enter` key
* Book cards (which don't seem to float at different sizes and different data received :) )
* 'Found X result' string
* Pagination
* Page with additional information about the book
* Loader while we're getting books list
* Responsive (I guess)
